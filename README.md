# School Management App

The aim of this project is to have a robust application where a student can store their notes, to-do tasks and grades. All the data is stored using the browser's local storage, so your data doesn't go to the cloud, it stays on your computer. ***Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that is more secure***.

The project is primarily built using TypeScript, Nextjs and TailwindCSS.
